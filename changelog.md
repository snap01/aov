## 13.16
- There is now a GM Tool for "Character Creation Phase" - which will allow some automation of character creation - you don't have to use it, you can still enter details manually.
- A short demo is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WiwFc4DVgE
- There are three new item types - Species, Homeland and History Items
- A species is used to set the Dice for rolling Stats along with the Min and Max, plus hit locations.  You can either add a Species item to a character, or enter the info manually
- Homeland is used to etermine starting skills, passions, equipment and Family History options.
- History items are used in conjunction with Rollable Tables (which are added to Homelands) to help with automated character creation.
- Please see the wiki for more detailed instructions on how to create the various items and how to use the Creation Phase.
- There is a new setting under display options for small screens - it uses a smaller version of the character sheet.
- Added a new CCI Drawing Toggle plus minor tweak to CCI Tile Toggle Layout and hints along (thanks James)
- There is a social status attribute now on the Stats tab that can be edited.
- Age of Vikings settings windows now use Light Mode only to make them more visible.
- Steadfast personality no longer adds the +20% bonus to weapons

- You can add a wound directly to a Character's hit location by clicking on the "AP/HP" section of the hit location (except in Development mode).
- Dropping specialised skills on the character now asks for a specialisation if it's not already on the skill

- Fixed an issue that the proper character sheet background wasnt showing on Linux systems
- A few housekeeping things in preparation for a later update

## 13.14
- The Chaosium Canvas Interface was designed for the Call of Cthulhu system, but thanks to James B (who created the CCI) it has been ported it over to Age of Vikings.
- James has kindly simplified the user interface so it needs less technical know-how to set up the options, but it does mean it may be slightly more limiting than the Call of Cthulhu version.
- Instructions are over on the wiki - https://github.com/Genii-Locorum/aov/wiki/Chaosium-Canvas-Interface-%E2%80%90CCI
- Added an instructions journal in the system which points users to the wiki

- NPCs now have a "notes" section that appears to the right of the NPC sheet and can be shown/hidden using the "scroll" icon on the NPC sheet
- NPCs also display Passions and Devotions
- Each section in the NPC sheet can be expanded or collapsed, and there are "collapse all" and "expand all" icons at the top
- When an NPC sheet is locked - the powers, passions, devotions and equipment sections are only shown if they have items.  Unlock the sheet to see all the sections

- Fixed a bug on NPCs and rolls where skill value was returning Not a Number due to missing ENC Penalty
- When making a damage roll following a combat roll with two parties the system knows who the target is and therefore will offer the person rolling damage the option to roll the hit location of the target that's struck.

- Although Dedication Points (now renamed from Devotion Points - oops) are changed with a drop down menu showing 0-3 DP, the value selected will be capped based on the relevant Worship skill

## 13.11
-  Changed default journal font colour so it is visible in Dark Mode
-  You can manually add <div class="aovJnl"> at the start of a journal and </div> at the end to use some inbuilt format options that look like the rulebook (see the aov-journal.css file for what's available)
