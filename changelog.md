## 13.14
- The Chaosium Canvas Interface was designed for the Call of Cthulhu system, but thanks to James B (who created the CCI) it has been ported it over to Age of Vikings.
- James has kindly simplified the user interface so it needs less technical know-how to set up the options, but it does mean it may be slightly more limiting than the Call of Cthulhu version.
- Instructions are over on the wiki - https://github.com/Genii-Locorum/aov/wiki/Chaosium-Canvas-Interface-%E2%80%90CCI
- Added an instructions journal in the system which points users to the wiki

## 13.13
- NPCs now have a "notes" section that appears to the right of the NPC sheet and can be shown/hidden using the "scroll" icon on the NPC sheet
- NPCs also display Passions and Devotions
- Each section in the NPC sheet can be expanded or collapsed, and there are "collapse all" and "expand all" icons at the top
- When an NPC sheet is locked - the powers, passions, devotions and equipment sections are only shown if they have items.  Unlock the sheet to see all the sections

- Fixed a bug on NPCs and rolls where skill value was returning Not a Number due to missing ENC Penalty

## 13.11
-  Changed default journal font colour so it is visible in Dark Mode
-  You can manually add <div class="aovJnl"> at the start of a journal and </div> at the end to use some inbuilt format options that look like the rulebook (see the aov-journal.css file for what's available)
